# audible-cli

**audible-cli** is a command line interface for the 
[Audible](https://github.com/mkb79/Audible) package. 
Both are written with Python.

## Requirements

audible-cli needs at least *Python 3.6* and *Audible v0.6.0*.

It depends on the following packages:

* aiofiles
* audible
* click
* colorama (on Windows machines)
* httpx
* Pillow
* tabulate
* toml
* tqdm

## Installation

You can install audible-cli from pypi with

```shell

pip install audible-cli

```

or install it directly from GitHub with

```shell

git clone https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli.git
cd audible-cli
pip install .

```

## Standalone executables

If you don't want to install `Python` and `audible-cli` on your machine, you can
find standalone exe files below or on the [releases](https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli/releases) 
page (including beta releases). At this moment Windows, Linux and macOS are supported.

On every execution, the binary code must be extracted. On Windows machines this can result in a long start time. If you use `audible-cli` often, I would prefer the `directory` package for Windows!

### Creating executables on your own

You can create them yourself this way

```shell

git clone https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli.git
cd audible-cli
pip install .[pyi]

# onefile output
pyinstaller --clean -F --hidden-import audible_cli -n audible -c pyi_entrypoint

# onedir output
pyinstaller --clean -D --hidden-import audible_cli -n audible -c pyi_entrypoint
```

### Hints

There are some limitations when using plugins. The binary maybe does not contain
all the dependencies from your plugin script. 

## Tab Completion

Tab completion can be provided for commands, options and choice values. Bash, 
Zsh and Fish are supported. More information can be found 
[here](https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli/tree/master/utils/code_completion).


## Basic information

### App dir

audible-cli use an app dir where it expects all necessary files.

If the ``AUDIBLE_CONFIG_DIR`` environment variable is set, it uses the value 
as config dir. Otherwise, it will use a folder depending on the operating 
system.

| OS       | Path                                      |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Windows  | ``C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\audible`` |
| Unix     | ``~/.audible``                            |
| Mac OS X | ``~/.audible``                            |

### The config file

The config data will be stored in the [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) 
format as ``config.toml``.

It has a main section named ``APP`` and sections for each profile created 
named ``profile.<profile_name>``

### profiles

audible-cli make use of profiles. Each profile contains the name of the 
corresponding auth file and the country code for the audible marketplace. If 
you have audiobooks on multiple marketplaces, you have to create a profile for 
each one with the same auth file.

In the main section of the config file, a primary profile is defined. 
This profile is used, if no other is specified. You can call 
`audible -P PROFILE_NAME`, to select another profile.

### auth files

Like the config file, auth files are stored in the config dir too. If you 
protected your auth file with a password call `audible -p PASSWORD`, to 
provide the password.

If the auth file is encrypted, and you don’t provide the password, you will be 
asked for it with a „hidden“ input field. 

### Config options

An option in the config file is separated by an underline. In the CLI prompt,
an option must be entered with a dash.

#### APP section

The APP section supports the following options:
- primary_profile: The profile to use, if no other is specified
- filename_mode: When using the `download` command, a filename mode can be 
  specified here. If not present, "ascii" will be used as default. To override
  these option, you can provide a mode with the `filename-mode` option of the
  download command.

#### Profile section

- auth_file: The auth file for this profile
- country_code: The marketplace for this profile
- filename_mode: See APP section above. Will override the option in APP section.

## Getting started

Use the `audible-quickstart` or `audible quickstart` command in your shell 
to create your first config, profile and auth file. `audible-quickstart` 
runs on the interactive mode, so you have to answer multiple questions to finish.

If you have used `audible quickstart` and want to add a second profile, you need to first create a new authfile and then update your config.toml file.

So the correct order is:

   1. add a new auth file using your second account using `audible manage auth-file add`
   2. add a new profile to your config and use the second auth file using `audible manage profile add`


## Commands

Call `audible -h` to show the help and a list of all available subcommands. You can show the help for each subcommand like so: `audible <subcommand> -h`. If a subcommand has another subcommands, you csn do it the same way.

At this time, there the following buildin subcommands: 

- `activation-bytes`
- `api`
- `download`
- `library`
    - `export`
    - `list`
- `manage`
    - `auth-file`
        - `add`
        - `remove`
    - `config`
        - `edit`
    - `profile`
        - `add`
        - `list`
        - `remove`
- `quickstart`
- `wishlist`
    - `export`
    - `list`
    - `add`
    - `remove`

## Example Usage

To download all of your audiobooks in the aaxc format use:
```shell
audible download --all --aaxc
```
To download all of your audiobooks after the Date 2022-07-21 in aax format use: 
```shell
audible download --start-date "2022-07-21" --aax --all
```

## Verbosity option

There are 6 different verbosity levels:

- debug
- info
- warning
- error
- critical

By default, the verbosity level is set to `info`. You can provide another level like so: `audible -v <level> <subcommand> ...`.

If you use the `download` subcommand with the `--all` flag there will be a huge output. Best practise is to set the verbosity level to `error` with `audible -v error download --all ...`

## Plugins

### Plugin Folder

If the ``AUDIBLE_PLUGIN_DIR`` environment variable is set, it uses the value 
as location for the plugin dir. Otherwise, it will use a the `plugins` subdir 
of the app dir. Read above how Audible-cli searches the app dir.

### Custom Commands

You can provide own subcommands and execute them with `audible SUBCOMMAND`.
All plugin commands must be placed in the plugin folder. Every subcommand must 
have his own file. Every file have to be named ``cmd_{SUBCOMMAND}.py``. 
Each subcommand file must have a function called `cli` as entrypoint. 
This function has to be decorated with ``@click.group(name="GROUP_NAME")`` or  
``@click.command(name="GROUP_NAME")``.

Relative imports in the command files doesn't work. So you have to work with 
absolute imports. Please take care about this. If you have any issues with 
absolute imports please add your plugin path to the `PYTHONPATH` variable or 
add this lines of code to the beginning of your command script:

```python
import sys
import pathlib
sys.path.insert(0, str(pathlib.Path(__file__).parent))
```

Examples can be found 
[here](https://github.com/mkb79/audible-cli/tree/master/plugin_cmds).


## Own Plugin Packages

If you want to develop a complete plugin package for ``audible-cli`` you can
do this on an easy way. You only need to register your sub-commands or 
subgroups to an entry-point in your setup.py that is loaded by the core 
package.

Example for a setup.py

```python
from setuptools import setup

setup(
    name="yourscript",
    version="0.1",
    py_modules=["yourscript"],
    install_requires=[
        "click",
        "audible_cli"
    ],
    entry_points="""
        [audible.cli_plugins]
        cool_subcommand=yourscript.cli:cool_subcommand
        another_subcommand=yourscript.cli:another_subcommand
    """,
)
```

## Command priority order

Commands will be added in the following order:

1. plugin dir commands
2. plugin packages commands
3. build-in commands

If a command is added, all further commands with the same name will be ignored.
This enables you to "replace" build-in commands very easy.
